## Tip #1

For Unordered lists, you can use `*` `+` `-`. that means these two codes have same output:

```markdown
* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
* Consectetur adipiscing elit
* Integer molestie lorem at massa
```

```markdown
+ Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
* Consectetur adipiscing elit
- Integer molestie lorem at massa
```

## Tip #2

These three codes have same output, because Markdown recognizes that you want to create Ordered lists:

```markdown
1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa
4. Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
5. Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
```

```markdown
1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
1. Consectetur adipiscing elit
1. Integer molestie lorem at massa
1. Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
1. Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
```

```markdown
1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
8. Consectetur adipiscing elit
112. Integer molestie lorem at massa
9. Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
3532. Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
```

Pay attention that the first one should be `1.` , and else it can't recognize Ordered list.


## Tip #3

If you want to add inline code like this in `GitHub & Notion`, you have to put the code in back quote (`` ` ``):

In python for print the type of data, we use `` `print(type())` ``

Output:

In python for print the type of data, we use `print(type())`

## Tip #4

If your code is in a line or more, you can use three back quotes (`` ``` ``) at the beginning:

\```
stringÂ =Â 'paliprox'
print(string.islower())Â #Â True

stringÂ =Â 'PaliProx'
print(string.islower())Â #Â False
\```

Output:

```
string = 'paliprox'
print(string.islower()) # True
  
string = 'PaliProx'
print(string.islower()) # False
```

## Tip #4.1

Many Markdown processors support syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks. This feature allows you to add color highlighting for whatever language your code was written in. To add syntax highlighting, specify a language next to the backticks before the fenced code block.

\```json  
{  
  "firstName": "John",  
  "lastName": "Smith",  
  "age": 25  
}  
\```

Output:

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```
