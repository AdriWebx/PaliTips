# Lesson 2

# Headers

---

Let's take a look at another formatting convention: the header. Headers are frequently used on websites, magazine articles, and notices, to draw attention to a section. As their name implies, they act like titles or subtitles above sections.

There are six types of headers, in decreasing sizes:

To make headers in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark (`#`). You place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want. For example, for a header one, you'd use one hash mark (`# Header One`), while for a header three, you'd use three (`### Header Three`).

For this next lesson, make each header the right size.

```markdown
Header one
Header two
Header three
Header four
Header five
Header six
```

<details>
<summary>Show the answer</summary>

```markdown
# Header one
## Header two
### Header three
#### Header four
##### Header five
###### Header six
```
</details>

**Tip:** For better codes, use space before the text you want to make it header.

All right!

It's up to you to decide when it's appropriate to use which header. In general, headers one and six should be used sparingly.

You can't really make a header bold, but you can italicize certain words. In the box below, make the first line a heading level four, and italicize the name of the book (both of them):

```markdown
Colombian Symbolism in One Hundred Years of Solitude

Here's some words about the book One Hundred Years....
```

<details>
<summary>Show the answer</summary>

```markdown
#### Colombian Symbolism in _One Hundred Years of Solitude_

Here's some words about the book _One Hundred Years..._.
```

Output:

#### **Colombian Symbolism in *One Hundred Years of Solitude***

Here's some words about the book *One Hundred Years...*.

</details>

And that's all there is to making headers in Markdown.
