# Lesson 1

# **Italics and Bold**

We'll start by learning two basic elements in text formatting: *italics* and **bold**. In these lessons, you'll notice some `formatted red text`; this text is actually written in Markdown! Regular Markdown doesn't look any different than regular text, but we're providing some highlighting to make it easier to see.

To make a phrase *italic* in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore (`_`). For example, `_this_` word would become *italic*.

For this next lesson, make the word "not" italic.

Awesome! Great job.

Similarly, to make phrases **bold** in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks ( `**` ). This will `**really**` get your point across.

In the box below, make the word "will" bold.

Good work!

Of course, you can use `_both italics and bold_` in the same line. You can also span them `**across multiple words**`.

In the box below, make the words "Of course" italic, and the words "a little moxie" bold.

```markdown
"Of course," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is a little moxie!"
```

```markdown
"_Of course_," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is **a little moxie**!"
```

Fantastic!

For the final exercise in this lesson, we're going to make some words *bold **and** italic*.

In general, it doesn't matter which order you place the asterisks or underscores. In the box below, make the words "This is unbelievable" both bold and italic. Place the asterisks `**_on the outside_**`, just to make it more legible.

```markdown
If you're thinking to yourself, This is unbelievable, you'd probably be right.
```

```markdown
If you're thinking to yourself, **_This is unbelievable_**, you'd probably be right.
```

Now you know how to make things bold and italic in Markdown!
